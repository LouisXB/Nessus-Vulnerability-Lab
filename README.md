# Nessus-Vulnerability-Lab
Nessus Vulnerability Scanning and Management Lab

In that project I create a Windows 10 VM using VMWare and expose it do a number of vulnerabilities including disabled firewalls and depricated software. I then use Tenable Nessus Essentials to perform both a credentialed and non-credentialed vulnerability scan. After reviewing the results and identifying the vulnerbilities, I perform a series of remediation steps in the VM to secure my virtual enviornment and protect against potential attacks.
